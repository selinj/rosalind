Compiling my solutions as I work through the problems on Rosalind, the bioinformatics learning platform, and learn Python in the process over Summer 2015 - https://rosalind.info

*Note on numbering:* Rosalind's problems are organized and linked in a tree structure - I haven't necessarily completed the problems in numeric order.
