# rosalind

Compiling my solutions as I work through the problems on Rosalind, the bioinformatics learning platform (rosalind.info), and learn Python and Biopython.

*Note on numbering:* Rosalind's problems are organized and linked in a tree structure - I haven't necessarily completed the problems in numeric order.
